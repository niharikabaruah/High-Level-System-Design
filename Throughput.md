# Throughput

Throughput is the rate at which a system can process requests or data in a given amount of time. It's a measure of how much work a system can do.

### How is Throughput Measured?

Throughput is typically measured in:

*   **Requests per second (RPS or QPS - Queries Per Second):** This is common for web servers and APIs.
*   **Transactions per second (TPS):** Used for databases and financial systems.
*   **Data transfer rate:** Measured in bits per second (bps), megabytes per second (MB/s), or gigabytes per second (GB/s). This is common for networking systems.

### Relationship between Latency and Throughput

Latency and throughput are related, but they are not the same thing.

*   A system can have **high throughput** but also **high latency**. Imagine a batch processing system. It might process thousands of records per second (high throughput), but each individual record might take several minutes to process (high latency).

*   A system can have **low latency** but also **low throughput**. A system might respond to a single request very quickly (low latency), but it might not be able to handle many requests at once (low throughput).

*   Ideally, we want a system with both **low latency** and **high throughput**.

Think of it like a highway:

*   **Latency** is the time it takes for a single car to get from one end of the highway to the other.
*   **Throughput** is the number of cars that can pass a certain point on the highway in an hour.

You can increase the throughput of the highway by adding more lanes. This doesn't necessarily decrease the time it takes for a single car to travel the full length of the highway (latency), but it allows more cars to travel at the same time.

### Factors Affecting Throughput:

1.  **Hardware:** The processing power (CPU), memory (RAM), and I/O speed of the system's hardware are fundamental limits on throughput.
2.  **Network Bandwidth:** The maximum amount of data that can be transferred over a network connection.
3.  **System Architecture:** A well-designed system with parallel processing and efficient algorithms can achieve higher throughput.
4.  **Concurrency:** The number of requests that a system can handle simultaneously.
5.  **Application Logic:** The complexity of the operations being performed.

### How to Improve Throughput:

*   **Scaling:**
    *   **Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up):** Increasing the resources of a single server (e.g., more CPU, RAM).
    *   **Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out):** Adding more servers to distribute the load.
*   **Performance Optimization:** Improving the efficiency of the code and database queries.
*   **Caching:** Reducing the number of requests that need to be processed by the backend.
*   **Asynchronous Processing:** Using message queues and background jobs to process tasks without blocking the main application thread. This allows the system to accept new requests while still working on previous ones.
*   **Load Balancing:** Distributing traffic across multiple servers to prevent any single server from being overwhelmed.
